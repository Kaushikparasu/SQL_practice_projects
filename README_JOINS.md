# üß† SQL Mini-Project: Multi-Table Joins Practice

This project focuses on mastering **SQL joins** using a realistic, multi-table dataset containing `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, and `support_tickets`.

## üì¶ Dataset Overview

| Table Name        | Description                                   |

| `customers`       | Customer details (name, country, email)       |
| `orders`          | Orders placed by customers                    |
| `order_items`     | Products within each order                    |
| `support_tickets` | Customer support issues                       |

‚úîÔ∏è Includes **NULLs**, **missing links**, and **duplicate-prone** data to mimic real-world scenarios.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Practice `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `FULL` joins
- Use `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `WHERE`, subqueries, and `CTEs`
- Handle NULLs and mismatched foreign keys
- Write **readable**, **modular**, and **efficient** SQL
